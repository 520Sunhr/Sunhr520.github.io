<p>Often, in an average pub, the beer is served in a mug which is, quite obviously, wet from inside,but also wet from outside. The barkeeper typically has no capacity to dry freshly washedmugs. To protect the table and the (optional!) tablecloth, beer coasters are used in mostpubs. Originally, the beer coasters were round, nowadays you can fifind a variety of difffferentshapes. Despite being perceived as slightly unorthodox, square and even rectangular coastersare manufactured and used daily in many self-respecting restaurants, taverns, beer houses anddrinkeries of high and low profifiles.</p>
<p>A research related to the well-known satiric Ig Nobel Prize is being conducted in local pubs.The research aims to measure the rate of wear of the rectangular coasters. The rate of weardepends also on how much a coaster is getting wet from the contact with the wet bottom of beermugs. That, in turn, depends on the exact area of contact between the mug and the coaster.The exact position of the coaster and the mug on the table is recorded each time the mug is puton the coaster.</p>

<p>The input contains 7 space-separated integers on a single line. The fifirst three integers X, Y , R describe the coordinates of the beer mug bottom on the table. The center of the mug bottom is at (X, Y ) and the radius of the mug bottom is R. The next four integers Ax, Ay, Bx, By describe the coordinates of two opposite corners, (Ax, Ay) and (Bx, By), of the coaster on the table. The coaster is a rectangle placed with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. All coordinates are in the range from m 1000 to 1000, the radius is in the range from 1 to 1000. The radius and the coordinates are expressed in the same units of length.</p>

<p>We are given a (drunken) image of stars as seen by a drunken man lying on his back on thegrass in the vicinity of a closed pub late in the evening. His image is a blend of one original(sober) image, and a copy of the same image shifted by some fifixed (X, Y ) nonzero vector. Onlythe resulting blended image is perceived by the drunkard. Neither the original sober image northe shift vector are available to him and to us, unfortunately. </p>
<p>An act of humanity would be to restore his perceived image to the version seen by his soberfellow citizens. </p>
<p>Given an image, write a program which calculates how many distinct (X, Y ) vectors exist suchthat the drunken image can be created by merging some original sober image with its copyshifted by the vector. </p>
<p>Note that if the images of two difffferent stars — one in the original image and the other in itsshifted copy — overlap in the blended image, then the drunken image, which is also the inputof the program, contains only one entry for this position. </p>
<p>** Input Specifification **</p>
<p>The fifirst line of input contains an integer N (0 &lt; N ≤ 1000), the number of stars in theblended (drunken) image. Next, there are N lines, each with two space-separated integers Xi, Yi (( 1000 ≤ Xi, Yi ≤ 1000) describing the position of a star. All stars are regarded to be pointswith no dimensions. </p>
<p>** Output Specifification **</p>
<p>Print the number of distinct vectors with non-zero length which can be applied to an unknownsober picture to produce the input drunken image. The unknown image might be difffferent indifffferent cases. </p>

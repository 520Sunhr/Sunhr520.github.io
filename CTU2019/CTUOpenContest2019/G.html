<p>Damian is a beer mug collector. His collection fifills most of the shelves in his vintage woodencabinet where all mugs are proudly displayed. The mugs are of various brands. There might be,and often are, more mugs of the same brand in the collection.</p>
<p>Mugs on a shelf in Damian’s collection always form a single symmetric row. Specififically, thesymmetry of the row means that the sequence of particular mug brands in the row is the samewhen the mugs are being admired one by one from left to right and when the mugs are beingadmired one by one from right to left. There is still one empty shelf in the cabinet and Damianlooks for an opportunity to fifill it with a new set of mugs. </p>
<p>The widely recognized Mastodon brewery (admired for its Woolly Mammoth beer) organizesannually the so-called beer season. Participants of the season are engaged in daily beer brewingactivities and are rewarded each day by a special collector mug. Each day in the season isassigned a particular mug brand. The mug brands for all days in the season are known inadvance, some brands may appear repeatedly in the season. </p>
<p>A participant may subscribe for the whole season or just for a part of the season. However, alldays of his or her participation have to be in one uninterrupted sequence of days, a participantcannot leave the season and then come back again after some days of absence. </p>
<p>Damian is keen to take part in the beer season. He decided that the set of mugs he brings homeshould be suited for his display without adding or removing any mug, and that the set shouldbe as big as possible. </p>

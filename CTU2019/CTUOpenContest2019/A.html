<p>Finally, you got into the cellar of your preferred brewery where you expected many large piles ofbeer barrels to be stored. You are eager to inspect the barrels and maybe even their content (alot and lot of content, actually…). Unfortunately, you find only five barrels, all hopelessly emptyand dry. Some numbers are painted on the fifirst four barrels, one number on each of them. Anote is attached to the fififth barrel. Behind the barrels in the dark, there is some low and barelydiscernible door in the wall, leading quite obviously to another lower cellar where you hope awhole slew of full barrels is kept hidden. The door is locked with a heavy and complex lookinglock. With no obvious further constructive action in mind, you sit down to study the note onthe fififth barrel.</p>
<p>Its essence is the following.</p>
<p>Denote the numbers painted on the fifirst, second, third and fourth barrel by A, B, K and C.Numbers A, B and C are just single digits.</p>
<p>Now imagine that in the distant future some incredibly powerful computer (powered by quantumyeast) prints a list of all numbers which have exactly K digits and in which each digit is equalto A or B. Another equally mighty computer then takes the list and also the value C as theinput and calculates the number of occurrences of digit C in the whole list.</p>
<p>The resulting number taken modulo 1 000 000 007 is to be typed into the door lock to open itand to gain access to the lower cellar.</p>
<p>You decide to calculate that number in your notebook you took with you.</p>
<p>** Input Specifification ** </p>
<p>The input consists of a single line with four integers A, B, K, C (1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 9, 0 ≤ K ≤ 1000)which represent the numbers painted on the fifirst four barrels.</p>
<p>** Output Specifification **</p>
<p>Output a single integer which opens the door lock. </p>

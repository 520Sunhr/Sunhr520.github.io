<p>You are visiting a lovely garden, with several points of interest.  Every pair of points of interest have a single, one way path (edge) connecting them.  (The paths are one way so that guests don’t get upset having to deal with other guests walking in the opposite direction.)  Luckily, you get to decide which point of interest to begin from.  Naturally, to get your money’s worth, you’d like to visit as many of the points of interest as possible without revisiting any point of interest, since that would be a waste of time.  Determine a walking path that allows you to visit the maximal number of points of interest without repeating any of them. </p>
<p>The Problem:  </p>
<p>Given a directed graph containing exactly one edge (path) between every pair of vertices (points of interest), determine a walking path of maximal length that doesn’t revisit any vertex. </p>
<p>The Input:  </p>

<p>The Output:  </p>
<p>For each garden, on a line by itself, output a space separated list of any maximal length sequence of unique points of interest to visit.  </p>
